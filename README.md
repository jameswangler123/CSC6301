### Week 4 Coding Project - Linked List
This program reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves them into a Linked List sorted from the smallest to the largest. This program utilizes the Collections Framework.
### Week 5 Coding Project - Stack
Similar to the Week 4 project, this program reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves them into a Stack sorted from the smallest to the largest. This program utilizes the Collections Framework.
### Installation
1. Download the desired .java file
2. Navigate to its file location using the terminal
3. Use javac filenamehere.java to compile the code
4. Use java filenamehere.java to run the program
### Usage
Both programs will ask the user to first enter the total number of integers they would like to see in either the Linked List or Stack. The user will then be prompted to continue to enter integers specified by the previous entry of total number of integers. Both programs will then display the sorted Linked Link or Stack.
